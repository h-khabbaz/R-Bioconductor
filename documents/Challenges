Challenge 1
Gene Expression Summary


Challenge 2
Calculate the mean expression level of gene “Dok3” by timepoints.



Challenge 3
3.1.How many genes were analysed in each sample?
3.2.Use group_by() and summarise() to evaluate the sequencing depth (the sum of all counts) in each sample. Which sample has the highest sequencing depth?
3.3.Pick one sample and evaluate the number of genes by biotype.
3.4.Identify genes associated with the “abnormal DNA methylation” phenotype description, and calculate their mean expression (in log) at time 0, time 4 and time 8.
